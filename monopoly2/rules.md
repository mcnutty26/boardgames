# Monopoly: the Extended Cut

## Introduction
These rules are designed to supplement the original rules for Monopoly. Rules in this document take precedence over those in the game as sold.

## Philosophy
As a game, monopoly has a number of large flaws. Firstly, it takes an age to play; a game aimed at the demographic monolpoly should always be finished in under two hours.
Secondly, the climax of the game is somewhere near the midpoint. After this, most players know if they're in the running or not, and those who are not on the right side of the dollar bills face the prospect of another hour or two of misery. This also disrupts the game in that it encourages kingmaking by losing players in an attempt to retain agency.
Finally, there is a high degree of randomness in the way the game plays out. While acceptable for shorter games, this tends to lessen engagement when extended to several hours for all but the winning players.

With that in mind, what makes monopoly a game that people are willing to put themselves through despite it not really being fun?
Trading forms the core of the experience, and I think that the feeling that people want is that of "legitimate capitalism" - that it's okay to take your friend's last dollar because they landed on a house that you own.

The problem is then, that bartering takes up a lot of the average monopoly game, and that because money slowly begets more money, players end up losing hours before they've actually lost. The things that make monopoly good are also the things that make it uplayable.
In my opinion, the best games are those that are monotonic (the game always either advances towards an ending condition, or remains in the same state) and have decisions made by players take increasing significance as the games progresses.

## Property
* Only three houses, instead of the usual four, are required on a property before a hotel can be built
* The rent price for a property with a hotel on it the same as if it had four houses (the printed hotel rent is ignored)
* Auctions take the form of a blind auction: each player commits privately to a bid amount, then all players reveal their bids and the player who bid the most receives the property from the bank in exchange for payment of the bid amount
* In the event of a tie during an auction, the player nearest to the current player (proceeding clockwise) wins
* Property cannot be mortgaged

## Money
* Remove all one pound notes from the game
* Each player begins the game with six Â£5 notes instead of the usual five

## Trading
* On a player's turn, that player is allowed to offer one trade to another player, who may then accept or decline (they are allowed to give a reason for declining)
* No other trading is permitted

## Movement
* Rolling a double for the second time in a turn has no special effect (the player moves as normal and does not roll again)

## Jail
* Landing on the go o jail square has no effect
* Remove from the chance and community chest decks all cards which put a player in, or removes them from, jail

## Winning the game
* A player wins the game if at any point they control four complete sets of properties (including utilities and stations)
